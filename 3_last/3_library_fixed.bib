@article{Viola2003,
abstract = {Time-delay estimation (TDE) is a common operation in ultrasound signal processing. In applications such as blood flow estimation, elastography, phase aberration correction, and many more, the quality of final results is heavily dependent upon the performance of the time-delay estimator implemented. In the past years, several algorithms have been developed and applied in medical ultrasound, sonar, radar, and other fields. In this paper we analyze the performances of the widely used normalized and non-normalized correlations, along with normalized covariance, sum absolute differences (SAD), sum squared differences (SSD), hybrid-sign correlation, polarity-coincidence correlation, and the Meyr-Spies method. These techniques have been applied to simulated ultrasound radio frequency (RF) data under a variety of conditions. We show how parameters, which include center frequency, fractional bandwidth, kernel window size, signal decorrelation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affect the quality of the delay estimate. Simulation results also are compared with a theoretical performance limit set by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Results show that, for high SNR, high signal correlation, and large kernel size, all of the algorithms closely match the theoretical bound, with relative performances that vary by as much as 20\%. As conditions degrade, the performances of various algorithms differ more significantly. For signals with a correlation level of 0.98, SNR of 30 dB, center frequency of 5 MHz with a fractional bandwidth of 0.5, and kernel size of 2 micros, the standard deviation of the jitter error is on the order of few nanoseconds. Normalized correlation, normalized covariance, and SSD have an approximately equal jitter error of 2.23 ns (the value predicted by the CRLB is 2.073 ns), whereas the polarity-coincidence correlation performs less well with a jitter error of 2.74 ns.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) is a theory about that one may achieve an exact signal reconstruction from the enough CS measurements taken from a sparse signal. However, in practical applications, the transform coefficients of SAR images usually have the weak sparsity. Exactly reconstructing these images is very challenging. A new Bayesian evolutionary pursuit algorithm (BEPA) is proposed in this paper. A signal is represented as the sum of a main signal and some residual signals, and the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is employed as the prior of the main signal and the residual signals. BEPA decomposes the residual iteratively, and estimates the maximum a posteriori of the main signal and the residual signals by solving a sequence of sub-problems, so as to achieve the approximate CS reconstruction of the signal. Under the assumption of GGD with the parameter 0<p<1 the evolutionary algorithm (EA) is introduced to CS reconstruction for the first time. The better reconstruction performance can be achieved by searching the global optimal solutions of sub-problems with EA. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the important features of SAR images (e.g. the point and line targets) can be well preserved by our algorithm, and the superior reconstruction performance can be obtained at the same time.},

@article{Booker1992,
abstract = {The partitioning of phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species between mixed micelles and vesicles was studied in each of seven human gallbladder biles. Biles were fractionated by Sephacryl S-300 SF gel filtration chromatography, and PC species in the micellar and vesicular fractions were quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography. Micelles were enriched in species containing unsaturated acyl groups (e.g., 16:1-18:2, 18:1-18:2, and 18:1-18:3); vesicles were enriched in more highly saturated species (e.g., 16:0-16:1, 16:0-18:1, and 18:0-18:1). Separate multivariate analyses for each bile demonstrated that the distribution of PC species between vesicles and micelles was related to the degree of sn-1 and sn-2 unsaturation, and sn-1, but not sn-2, chain length. In addition, the tendency to partition into the micellar phase was particularly marked when unsaturation was present at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. When this interaction was included in the multivariate analyses, the regression models accounted for virtually all of the variation in PC partitioning (for each of the seven patients r2 = 0.92-0.98, P less than 0.03). These results suggest that the partitioning of PC species between micelles and vesicles is strictly determined by sn-1 chain length and the degree of unsaturation at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. In light of recent reports that fatty acyl composition influences the cholesterol content of vesicles and micelles in model biles, these results raise the possibility that diet-induced alterations in the phospholipid species and the relative proportions of biliary lipid particles may influence the cholesterol-carrying capacity of bile.},

abstract = {Despite their success in identifying genes that affect complex disease or traits, current genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on a single SNP analysis are too simple to elucidate a comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of phenotypes. A simultaneous analysis of a large number of SNPs, although statistically challenging, especially with a small number of samples, is crucial for genetic modeling. Method: We propose a two-stage procedure for multi-SNP modeling and analysis in GWASs, by first producing a 'preconditioned' response variable using a supervised principle component analysis and then formulating Bayesian lasso to select a subset of significant SNPs. The Bayesian lasso is implemented with a hierarchical model, in which scale mixtures of normal are used as prior distributions for the genetic effects and exponential priors are considered for their variances, and then solved by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Our approach obviates the choice of the lasso parameter by imposing a diffuse hyperprior on it and estimating it along with other parameters and is particularly powerful for selecting the most relevant SNPs for GWASs, where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.},

On the other hand, compressive sampling (CS) based interior tomography is a new innovation. Combining the strengths of these two novel subjects, we apply the interior tomography technique to local mouse cardiac imaging using respiration and cardiac gating with a CNT based micro-CT scanner. The major features of our method are: (1) it does not need exact prior knowledge inside an ROI; and (2) two orthogonal scout projections are employed to regularize the reconstruction. Both numerical simulations and in vivo mouse studies are performed to demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology.},

abstract = {The statistical properties of heart beat intervals of 130 long-term surface electrocardiogram recordings during atrial fibrillation (AF) are investigated. We find that the distribution of interbeat intervals exhibits a characteristic exponential tail, which is absent during sinus rhythm, as tested in a corresponding control study with 72 healthy persons. The rate gamma of the exponential decay lies in the range 3-12 Hz and shows diurnal variations. It equals, up to statistical uncertainties, the level of the previously uncovered white noise part of the power spectrum, which is also characteristic for AF. The overall statistical features can be described by decomposing the intervals into two statistically independent times, where the first one is associated with a correlated process with 1/f noise characteristics, while the second one belongs to an uncorrelated process and is responsible for the exponential tail. It is suggested to use gamma as a further parameter for a better classification of AF and for the medical diagnosis. The relevance of the findings with respect to a general understanding of AF is discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we model the components of the compressive sensing (CS) problem, i.e., the signal acquisition process, the unknown signal coefficients and the model parameters for the signal and noise using the Bayesian framework. We utilize a hierarchical form of the Laplace prior to model the sparsity of the unknown signal. We describe the relationship among a number of sparsity priors proposed in the literature, and show the advantages of the proposed model including its high degree of sparsity. Moreover, we show that some of the existing models are special cases of the proposed model. Using our model, we develop a constructive (greedy) algorithm designed for fast reconstruction useful in practical settings. Unlike most existing CS reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm is fully automated, i.e., the unknown signal coefficients and all necessary parameters are estimated solely from the observation, and, therefore, no user-intervention is needed. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides estimates of the uncertainty of the reconstructions. We provide experimental results with synthetic 1-D signals and images, and compare with the state-of-the-art CS reconstruction algorithms demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing microarrays (CSMs) are DNA-based sensors that operate using group testing and compressive sensing (CS) principles. In contrast to conventional DNA microarrays, in which each genetic sensor is designed to respond to a single target, in a CSM, each sensor responds to a set of targets. We study the problem of designing CSMs that simultaneously account for both the constraints from CS theory and the biochemistry of probe-target DNA hybridization. An appropriate cross-hybridization model is proposed for CSMs, and several methods are developed for probe design and CS signal recovery based on the new model. Lab experiments suggest that in order to achieve accurate hybridization profiling, consensus probe sequences are required to have sequence homology of at least 80\% with all targets to be detected. Furthermore, out-of-equilibrium datasets are usually as accurate as those obtained from equilibrium conditions. Consequently, one can use CSMs in applications in which only short hybridization times are allowed.},

@article{Donoho2009,
abstract = {We review connections between phase transitions in high-dimensional combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis, such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model or the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial geometry, these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in these very different problems appear in the same critical locations after appropriate calibration of variables. These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard limits on the degree to which the now ubiquitous high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place hard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate outliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp boundary of the undersampling/sparsity trade-off curve in undersampling theorems. Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume that the underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed Gaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are universal across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. We ran millions of linear programs using random matrices spanning several matrix ensembles and problem sizes; visually, the empirical phase transitions do not depend on the ensemble, and they agree extremely well with the asymptotic theory assuming Gaussianity. Careful statistical analysis reveals discrepancies that can be explained as transient terms, decaying with problem size. The experimental results are thus consistent with an asymptotic large-n universality across matrix ensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.},

My proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model. The method is a variation of the 'lasso' proposal of Tibshirani, designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting.},

All existing methods, either based on the dogleg strategy of Hebden-Mor\'{e}e iterations, require solution of system of linear equations. In large scale optimization this may be prohibitively expensive. It is shown in this paper that an approximate solution of the trust region problem may be found by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This may be regarded as a generalized dogleg technique where we asymptotically take the inexact quasi-Newton step. We also show that we have the same convergence properties as existing methods based on the dogleg strategy using an approximate Hessian},

Our ultimate goal is to establish an alternative to the DCM analysis procedure which would eliminate its main drawbacks, namely the need to pre-define the models structure.

@article{Fontaine2011,
abstract = {When foraging, so-called FM-bats emit sequences of frequency modulated (FM) calls in order to detect, identify, and localize edible prey. Once a potential target has been detected, various call and call sequence parameters, such as frequency sweep, pulse duration, and inter pulse interval (IPI) vary. In this paper, the possible functions of the variation of the IPI are studied. In particular, it is conjectured that the IPI patterns are an adaptive behavior that optimizes the signal design parameters in order to improve information retrieval. Such an irregular sampling strategy would be useful whenever bats need to characterize signal modulation (e.g., the wing beat of an insect) using a call emission rate lower than the signal modulation of interest. This problem can be recast as extracting features, in this case the joint acoustic and modulation frequency representation, from signals sampled at frequencies well below the Nyquist cut-off frequency. To study the possibility of such target classification using a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme, results derived in the context of compressive sensing are used. Processing echoes collected from both rotating computer fans and fluttering locusts, it is shown that such a strategy would allow FM-bats to discriminate between targets based on their different fluttering rates.},

abstract = {In this paper, a sparse representation method is proposed for Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantification. An observed MR spectrum is composed of a set of metabolic spectra of interest, a baseline and a noise. To separate the spectra of interest, the a priori knowledge about these spectra, such as signal models, the peak frequencies and linewidth ranges of different resonances, is first integrated to construct a dictionary. The separation of the spectra of interest is then performed by using a pursuit algorithm to find their sparse representations with respect to the dictionary. For the challenging baseline problem, a wavelet filter is proposed to filter the smooth and broad components of both the observed spectra and the basis functions in the dictionary. The computation of sparse representation can then be carried out by using the remaining data. Simulation results show the good performance of this wavelet filtering based strategy in separating the overlapping components between the baselines and the spectra of interest when no appropriate model function for the baseline is available. Quantifications of in vivo brain MR spectra from tumor patients in different stages of progression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

There are numerous and very different approaches to tackle the inpainting problem, though as explained in this paper, the most successful algorithms are based upon one or two of the following three basic techniques: copy-and-paste texture synthesis, geometric partial differential equations (PDEs), and coherence among neighboring pixels. We combine these three building blocks in a variational model, and provide a working algorithm for image inpainting trying to approximate the minimum of the proposed energy functional. Our experiments show that the combination of all three terms of the proposed energy works better than taking each term separately, and the results obtained are within the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Super-resolution (SR) is the process of combining multiple aliased low-quality images to produce a high-resolution high-quality image. Aside from registration and fusion of low-resolution images, a key process in SR is the restoration and denoising of the fused images. We present a novel extension of the combined Fourier-wavelet deconvolution and denoising algorithm ForWarD to the multiframe SR application. Our method first uses a fast Fourier-base multiframe image restoration to produce a sharp, yet noisy estimate of the high-resolution image. Our method then applies a space-variant nonlinear wavelet thresholding that addresses the nonstationarity inherent in resolution-enhanced fused images. We describe a computationally efficient method for implementing this space-variant processing that leverages the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to minimize complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for regular imagery as well as in digital mammography.},
